    - area of circle = pi * radius * radius
    - circumference of circle = 2 * pi * radius
"""

# Solution

radius = 5
pi = 3.14

area = pi * radius * radius
print("The area of circle is: ", area)

circumference= 2 * pi * radius
print("The circumference of circle is: ", circumference)
