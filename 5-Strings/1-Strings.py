"""STRINGS"""

"""
- In Python, Just as in most of the programming languages you must put any free text inside a pair of quote characters.
- Otherwise Python will try to find the meaning in the text.1
- The pieces of texts are called "Strings".
- You can put string between two single quotes ie: ' ' or between two double quotes: " " , which does not matter
